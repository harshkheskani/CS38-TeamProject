# Introduction

This paper presents brief documentation on existing bugs (as of March
2022) as well as guide on how to use existing features.

# Bugs And Quirks

As of now, there are no known bugs present in the web application.
However, there are few quirks that should be noted especially for user
presentation.

## Quirks

Firsts thing to notice it that when registering business, auto fill
function is used to fill address field of business. This function also
fills invisible fields of latitude and longitude. Therefore, care should
be taken that this auto fill is used and that address is not just typed
in. This also applies to address field in Edit Business page.\
Second thing to notice is saving of different edits on Edit Business
Page. As you will see, there are can be multiple forms present on the
page, namely different Opening Hours forms and Business info form. These
form must be edited 1 at a time. For example, assume you have two
opening hours forms. You edit both of the and press edit button on one
of the two. Despite setting changes to both, only the form that had its
'Edit' button pressed will apply those changes. The rest of changes to
other forms will be discarded.
